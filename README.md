# Uniqueness

This application was developed as part of the 2019 Spring Corteva Agriscience Hackathon by a team in Johnston, Iowa. 

The theme of the hackathon was machine learning and we used a rudimentary algorithm inspired by genetic algorithms, the traveling salesman problem, and nearest neighbor concepts.  In the end the application should find a very good answer quickly but may never discover the absolute best answer.

Team members include:

    *  Dave Spaulding, Solutions Architect
    *  Deann Nelson, Research Analysist 
    *  Andrew Denner, Senior Software Developer
    *  Barry Nelson, Research Scientist
